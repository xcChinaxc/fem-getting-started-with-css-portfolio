## Overview

Overall goal was to refresh myself on basic CSS by recreating a two-page website from scratch using semantic HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```css
nav [class*='fa-'] {
  font-size: 150%;
  color: var(--aqua);
}
```

I did not realize I could select font awesome icons using `class *= 'fa-'`! Super cool and will be helpful when prototyping projects.
